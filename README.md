  ## Description
  I have worked with students for years on various subjects, and one of the common topics that students encounter is the Unit Circle from precalculus.  Being able to remember the trigonometric values of angles of the circle, both when the angles are expressed in degrees and when they are expressed in radians, seems to be required of every student in a precalculus or trigonometry course.  This application is a game of sorts that allows students to practice learning this information while saving certain statistics locally.  The project utilizes React and Redux.
